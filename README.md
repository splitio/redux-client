## Compatibility

This SDK is compatible with Redux v2.0.0 and later, and React-Redux v4.0.0 and later.

## Getting started

Below is a simple example that describes the instantiation and most basic usage of our SDK:

```javascript
// Import modules
import React from 'react';
import { createStore, applyMiddleware, combineReducers } from 'redux';
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
import { splitReducer, initSplitSdk, getTreatments,
  selectTreatmentValue, connectSplit } from '@splitsoftware/splitio-redux'

// Init Redux store
const store = createStore(
  combineReducers({
    splitio: splitReducer
    // You'll have your app reducers here too
  }),
  applyMiddleware(thunk)
);

// Define your config object and dispatch `initSplitSdk` action to init the SDK
const CONFIG = {
  core: {
    authorizationKey: 'YOUR_BROWSER_API_KEY',
    key: 'CUSTOMER_ID'
  }
};
store.dispatch(initSplitSdk({ config: CONFIG }))

// Dispach a `getTreatments` action to evaluate one or more splits.
// The evaluation is done asynchronously when the SDK is ready.
store.dispatch(getTreatments({ splitNames: 'SPLIT_NAME' }))

// Connect your component to splitio's piece of state
const MyComponent = connectSplit()(({ splitio }) => {
  // Check SDK readiness using isReady property
  if (!splitio.isReady)
    return <div>Loading SDK ...</div>;

  // Select a treatment value
  const treatment = selectTreatmentValue(splitio, 'SPLIT_NAME')
  if (treatment === 'on') {
    // return JSX for 'on' treatment
  } else if (treatment === 'off') {
    // return JSX for 'off' treatment
  } else {
    // return JSX for 'control' treatment
  }
});

ReactDOM.render(
  <Provider store={store}>
    <MyComponent />
  </Provider>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```
