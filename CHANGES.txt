1.1.1 (May XX, 2020)
 - Improved state updates on client-side: `getTreatments` async actions only update the state (via ADD_TREATMENTS actions) when the client is ready or when the evaluation of treatments changed on client updates.

1.1.0 (May 11, 2020)
 - Bugfixing - incorrect evaluation of splits on browser when using `getTreatments` with a different user key than the default, caused by not waiting the fetch of segments.
 - Added `destroySplitSdk` action creator to gracefully shutdown the SDK.
 - Added two new status properties to split's piece of state: `hasTimedout` and `isDestroyed` to better reflect the current state of the associated factory.

1.0.1 (April 6, 2020)
 - Updated dependencies to fix vulnerabilities
 - Bugfixing - support numbers as user keys

1.0.0 (January 24, 2020)
 - Initial public release!
