1.1.1 (Jul XX, 2020)
 - Added a return promise when dispatching `getTreatments` asycn action. The promise resolves with the treatments values when the SDK client is ready, and rejects if the client timeouts, i.e., it emits an SDK_READY_TIMED_OUT event).
 - Improved state updates on client-side: `getTreatments` async action only updates the Split state when the client is ready and when the treatment's values change.

1.1.0 (May 11, 2020)
 - Bugfixing - incorrect evaluation of splits on browser when using `getTreatments` with a different user key than the default, caused by not waiting the fetch of segments.
 - Added `destroySplitSdk` action creator to gracefully shutdown the SDK.
 - Added two new status properties to split's piece of state: `hasTimedout` and `isDestroyed` to better reflect the current state of the associated factory.

1.0.1 (April 6, 2020)
 - Updated dependencies to fix vulnerabilities
 - Bugfixing - support numbers as user keys

1.0.0 (January 24, 2020)
 - Initial public release!
